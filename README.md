# Guess-a-Number

### This small project was developed during the early weeks of the Code4All bootcamp. The objective of the project was to create a simple guessing game based on a set of challenges presented to the students. The challenges included:

**Game Mechanics:**

+ The system selects a random number.
+ Players take turns making guesses.
+ The game ends when a player correctly guesses the chosen number.
